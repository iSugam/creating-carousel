# Making my own carousel
## Note - I am still working on it to make it more efficient.
Trying to create my own carousel library for my future uses 

### Codes for using

```javascript
carousel({
    nextButton: ".next", // Class or Id selector of the Next button (Make sure to put . or #, and unique name for each class and id)
    prevButton: ".prev", // Class or Id selector of the Previous button (Make sure to put . or #, and unique name for each class and id)
    sliderItems: ".item", // class name of Carousel items
    transition: 300, // For CSS transition in miliseconds
    autoSlide: true, // Still working on it
    autoSlideDelay: 5, // Set delay on auto slide items
    delay: 0 // If delay is not needed then just remove it. By default it's 0.
})
```
